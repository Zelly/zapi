Sound functions
Color table may need to be done differently, kinda awkard and long to write atm
Client:
	print/chat functions
	callback setup
zapi/core/callbacks
	add some more logging
	add module loading
	custom callbacks: changestate switch team
command:
	needs everything
	might need string formatting functions

Add client setup in callbacks then finish the setup of clients and its functions
setup the game functions that relied on client handler
