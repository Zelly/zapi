Sound functions
Color table may need to be done differently, kinda awkard and long to write atm
Client:
	print/chat functions
	callback setup
zapi/core/callbacks
	add some more logging
	add module loading
	Custom callback ClientGibbed
		Check if this is possible, when testing is doable
	Will need file saving for client Connect order in order for it to be any use
command:
	needs everything
	might need string formatting functions
