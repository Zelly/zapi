Logger:
Filehandler:
ClientHandler
	everything
Core/now just putting everything in the original file
	go over game functions probably keep them all in core
	add log messages
	add module loading
	add bit functions
	custom callbacks like changestate and switch team
	
Commandhandler?

Misc
	A lot of string formatting tables was left out for its complexity and it has little use in the api
	if I am going to rebuild the command system it will need to be reimplemented

Color table
	done, may need to adjust zapi.color.WHITE etc..
	
add country table
add custom constants
add sound functions
Test things
Add comments

Add client setup in callbacks then finish the setup of clients and its functions
setup the game functions that relied on client handler
